Topic: NIL in college fooball

Overview:
For this project I wanted to focus on the divide that NIL is creating in college football. Its becoming nearly impossible for smaller school or team to compete with these large school who are able to spend so much more on their atheltics. One the the graphs shows how much the highest non power 5 conference spend, which is around 2 million. That happens to be what the SEC spends on one prospect. The idea is to show the true gap that has been created by the NCAA without limitations being places on this new concept that has completely taken over the college football landscape.

Sources:
This project used a combination of multiple different sources such as ON3 NIL valuation to get the NIL and then ESPN to add the players current team and conference.

Disclaimer:
NIL does not require players to disclose their earnings so the data set used was only the players estimated valuations which are subject to change. The fact that is non disclosed limited the data set to only the top 100 players as the data would not be accurate beyond that point.
